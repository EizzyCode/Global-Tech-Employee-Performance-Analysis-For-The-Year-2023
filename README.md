Before building the charts, I conducted a pre-analysis to better understand the dataset and guide my storytelling process. This involved breaking down the data into meaningful components:

**Project Split:** I categorized the data points into dependent and independent variables, helping me understand the relationships within the dataset and what types of insights could be extracted.

**Potential Analysis & Questions:** From the grouped variables, I generated key questions that the dataset could answer. This step highlighted the potential insights hidden within the data, even before visualizing it.

**Preliminary Insights:** By thinking through the questions and data points, I uncovered early insights, which made it easier to shape the narrative and focus the analysis on valuable outcomes.

**Storytelling:** Once I had a clear understanding of the dataset, I could tell a story from it. By putting together the relationships between the datapoints and the insights uncovered.

**Industry & Stakeholders:** This process helped me identify the relevant industry, the stakeholders who would benefit from the analysis, and what success would look like for the organization based on the findings.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8dde32c-dd92-4fdf-8877-cebf24eefc3c)
From the analysis, Field Operations and General Co Divisions are critical to the company’s growth due to their large size. More resources should be allocated to these divisions to enhance productivity, while smaller divisions should be evaluated to determine if they can be integrated into others.

Additionally, Asians demonstrate high work efficiency, so the company should maintain a strong representation of Asians during recruitment. To improve performance across all ethnic groups, mentoring or specialized training should be provided for lower-performing employees. High-performing Asians can be paired with low-performing Hispanic employees to enhance productivity.

Employees aged 57–66 years are the most experienced and highest-rated. The company should leverage their expertise by assigning them mentorship roles for younger employees and exploring retention strategies, such as contract extensions post-retirement. Additionally, the onboarding process should be improved to better integrate and develop younger employees. Encouraging collaboration between older and younger staff will facilitate knowledge transfer, create a more supportive work culture, and increase overall productivity.

Since widowed and divorced employees have the lowest performance ratings, the company should introduce mental health support systems and counseling services to assist them. Work-life balance policies should also be reviewed to ensure they adequately address the needs of employees across different marital statuses.

Meanwhile, the Field Operations Division, which has the highest-rated employees, can serve as a model for other divisions. To foster competition, the company should introduce incentives or bonuses for the best-performing division at the end of the year. Successful strategies from top-performing divisions should be identified and replicated in lower-performing divisions, and specialized training should be provided to underperforming divisions to boost productivity.

Employees who attended Communication Skills Training demonstrated significantly better performance. To maximize this benefit, the company should make communication skills training mandatory for all employees and integrate communication skills into all other training programs. Additionally, the effectiveness of Customer Service Training should be evaluated to determine if improvements are needed in the curriculum or trainers.

To ensure continuous improvement, the company should track employee development and progress on a quarterly basis, making necessary adjustments based on observations and trends. High-impact training programs should be introduced to foster a culture of continuous learning and career progression across all levels.

**CONCLUSION**

Implementing these recommendations will drive higher productivity, employee engagement, and overall business growth. By strategically allocating resources to key divisions, leveraging high-performing employees for mentorship, and fostering a culture of continuous learning, the company can enhance efficiency across all levels. Addressing the needs of underperforming groups through targeted training, incentives, and support systems will create a more inclusive and motivated workforce. Regular tracking of employee progress and refining training programs will ensure sustained improvement and adaptability in an evolving business landscape. By taking these steps, the company can build a resilient, high-performing workforce and secure long-term success.
